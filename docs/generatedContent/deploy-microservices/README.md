# Introduction to Microservice


### Prerequisite

   * Access to a Kubernetes cluster - A cluster was created when the session started

   * IBM Cloud Function sending email notification - was created before the session

   * Docker image of each service has been made available on Docker Hub.


### Setup

1. Lab Environment Setup

    Every time when you start a new terminal/command window, steps in the section must be performed to setup a new environment.

    [Follow the instructions here](README_pre02.md)


### Lab 1 - Deploy Office Space sample application on Kubernetes

This lab demonstrates how a sample cloud native application can be deployed on top of Kubernetes.

### Lab 2 - Develop a Java Microservice with Spring Boot

Optionally, if your IBM Cloud account supported a paid Kubernetes cluster, you may perform the steps in this lab to develop a `Java Microservice` in no time.

In this lab, you develop a Java Microservice using the `Java Microservice with Spring` starter kit. With this kit, you can have a basic Java microservice developed and deployed in a few minutes. You create a CI/CD pipeline in IBM Cloud which automates your service's deployment to Kubernetes cluster.
